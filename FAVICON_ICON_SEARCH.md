# Finding the Correct Favicon Icon

## 🎯 What We're Looking For

Based on your description, the favicon should show:
- **Stylized red logo** (looks like an "F" or flowing shape)
- **"So Fluent" text** in light grey
- **Dark background**
- **Separator line** on the left

## 📁 Current Logo Files Available

From `client/src/assets/branding/logos/PNG/`:
- `Cherry@2x.png` / `Cherry@3x.png` - Red/Cherry colored logo
- `Black@2x.png` / `Black@3x.png` - Black logo
- `White@2x.png` / `White@3x.png` - White logo
- `Logo 1@2x.png` - Logo variation 1
- `Logo 2@2x.png` - Logo variation 2
- `Old Gold@2x.png` / `Old Gold@3x.png` - Gold logo
- `Gris@3x.png` - Gray logo

## 🔍 Next Steps

**Option 1:** If there's a specific icon file in the brand kit:
- Please point me to the file path or folder name
- It might be in an "Ícone" (Icon) folder
- Or it might be named something like `favicon.png`, `icon.png`, or `app-icon.png`

**Option 2:** If one of the existing files is the icon:
- Which file matches the image you showed me?
- Is it `Logo 1@2x.png` or `Logo 2@2x.png`?
- Or is it the `Cherry@3x.png` file?

**Option 3:** If the icon needs to be created:
- I can create a favicon from one of the existing logo files
- Or extract the icon portion from a full logo file

## 💡 Quick Fix

I've temporarily set `Logo 1@2x.png` as the favicon. If this isn't the correct one, please let me know:
1. The exact filename of the icon file
2. Or the folder path where it's located
3. Or describe which of the existing files is the correct icon

**Current Status:** Using Logo 1@2x.png as favicon (can be changed once we identify the correct file)
